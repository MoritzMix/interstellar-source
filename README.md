interstellar coding challenge

Remarks, subsequent changes and link to source repo.

The positions of the nodes in the graph do not represent their actual position. The layout is created via force-simulation (https://bl.ocks.org/heybignick/3faf257bbbbc7743bb72310d03b86ee8). For performance and visual reasons the simulation stops after one step. If ran longer, the graph would "unfold" properly.

The weights (cost) of the edges are represented as and RGB color in a range between red, yellow and green (RdYlGn). Green being low cost and red being high cost.
